    <p>
      You know me the best<br>
      You know my worst, see me hurt, but you don't judge<br>
      That, right there is the scariest feeling<br>
      Opening and closing up again<br>
      I've been hurt so I don't trust<br>
      Now here we are, staring at the ceiling<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      I've said those words before but it was a lie<br>
      And you deserve to hear them a thousand times<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      I've said those words before but it was a lie<br>
      And you deserve to hear them a thousand times<br>
      If all it is is eight letters<br>
      Why is it so hard to say?<br>
      If all it is is eight letters<br>
      Why am I in my own way?<br>
      Why do I pull you close?<br>
      And then ask you for space<br>
      If all it is is eight letters<br>
      Why is it so hard to say?<br>
    </p>
